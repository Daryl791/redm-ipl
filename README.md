Just drop into your resouces and add to your server.cfg

Thanks goes out to Koil and pogoS finding the ipl hashes.  Without them, I would not have been able to make this. I was not even worried about looking for them.

I was originally just going to release this, for Southern California Wild West Roleplay. The work Koil did on his massive list and the original list pogoS did, in finding them. Also the lack of stuff, for server owners right now.  This is something that should be shared.
